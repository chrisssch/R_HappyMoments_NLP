# Text Classification using the Happy Moments Dataset

The purpose of this project is to practice text classification in R with a vocabulary-based method on a real-world dataset using the [tidytext package](https://www.tidytextmining.com/). This dataset is "HappyDB: A Corpus of 100,000 Crowdsourced Happy Moments", created by Asai et al. in 2018. From their description:

*HappyDB is a corpus of more than 100,000 happy moments crowd-sourced via Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk.
*Each worker is given the following task: What made you happy today? Reflect on the past 24 hours, and recall three actual events that happened to you that made you happy. Write down your happy moment in a complete sentence. (Write three such moments.)*
